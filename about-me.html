    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
        I'm JB Ladera. I've been playing video games ever since I was young. After seeing my older sister playing
        games
        on Facebook in 2008-2009, I gained an interest to play video games myself. I eventually got into more games
        such as <span class="game">Pokémon</span>, <span class="game">Minecraft</span>, and <span class="game">Call of
            Duty</span>, which were big parts of my life during 2010-2015. Since 2015
        I'd
        say the games that I've played the most are now <span class="game">League of Legends</span>, <span
            class="game">osu!</span>, <span class="game">VALORANT</span>, and <span class="game">Minecraft</span>. I
        very
        much
        prefer playing games that have some sort of competitive aspect to it with other players, so I don't really
        play
        singleplayer games. Although I do sometimes watch streamers play singleplayer games, which is nice since I
        don't
        have to play all the slow parts, and the streamers themselves can be entertaining.

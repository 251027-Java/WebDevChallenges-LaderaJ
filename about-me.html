    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I'm JB Ladera. I've been playing video games ever since I was young. After seeing my older sister playing games
        on Facebook in 2008-2009, I gained an interest to play video games myself. I eventually got into more games
        such as Pokémon, Minecraft, and Call of Duty, which were big parts of my life during 2010-2015. Since 2015 I'd
        say the games that I've played the most are now League of Legends, osu!, VALORANT, and Minecraft. I very much
        prefer playing games that have some sort of competitive aspect to it with other players, so I don't really play
        singleplayer games. Although I do sometimes watch streamers play singleplayer games, which is nice since I don't
        have to play all the slow parts, and the streamers themselves can be entertaining.
